                    Most of us -testers- have the "Q" part in our title, Quallity Assurance / Quallity Control and all the other derivates. But how much of what we do on a daily basis is related to software quality and how much is related to "does it work as intendend?", still quality related but the reason we don't have the same phone, clothes, drinks is because of the "other" quality attributes. In this edition of Tester's pub we'll present, discuss, debate and tell jokes about software quality and show that quality is universal and the first step to improving it is being aware of it. Let's find the answer to "What the illity?"

                    TNT was created as a honey-colored yellow dye for clothes, never having the purpose to be a world-renowned explosive. Same can happen with our automation frameworks over time if we don’t pay attention. What started as a cute POC, might turn into a nightmare. I will share with you my safety net for preventing this.
